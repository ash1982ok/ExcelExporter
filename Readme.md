  This is a javascript library which will output the data in Excel format using Open office xml format.

Contributors are welcome :)


A Big Thanks to :

1) Downloadify Project 

2) Ext.ux.Exporter Project

This will work only on server because of Flash Player Security Sandbox.


The end result of the library will be a long string having data provided wrapped on ooxml format.
